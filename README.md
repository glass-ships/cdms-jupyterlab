# SuperCDMS JupyterLab

## Overview

SLAC maintains a number of JupyterLab images for various research projects.
This repository contains the code used to build an image for dark matter analysis by the SuperCDMS experiment.

**Dependencies:** 
- Docker CE Edge ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/))

**Notes:**  
- Docker requires sudo acces, or that the user be added to the `Docker` group 
- SSH access to CDMS git repositories
- All cloning is done locally - SSH keys remain secure. 

## Usage

Documentation on the official SuperCDMS JupyterLab image is available to SLAC users via [Confluence](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/CDMS/How+to+get+started+with+analysis).

If you're interested in building your own Docker image for local use: 

- You'll need to change every instance of `josh@nero` in `./build.sh` to reflect your SLAC username
- JupyterLab is installed via pip, so you'll want to add a `RUN` statement at the end of `./Dockerfile` that launches JupyterLab when the container starts up
	- You may need to provide some environment variables for JupyterLab to run properly. Check any error output for clues about where to start. 
		- (I'll update this documentation with more useful information as I learn more about these variables)
- `./build.sh` provides an example script that you'll likely want to adjust to fit your needs.
